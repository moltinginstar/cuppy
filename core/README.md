# Cuppy

Cuppy is a lightweight, TypeScript-based, dependency-free, and easy-to-use library for automatically adjusting historical currency amounts for inflation. It is based on the [US Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) data provided by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/). (Cuppy is how CPI would be pronounced if economics was any fun.)
